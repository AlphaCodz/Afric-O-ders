<h2>What is OpenSource and why you should contribute</h2>
<p>The term ‘open source’ describes software that is available on an open source licence that shares the source code or human readable code, and allows anyone using the code on that licence to maintain and modify the code.

* Open Source helps you increase you skills

* Community - Like the African proverb, it takes a whole comunity to raise a child, you need a lot of people to become one of the best if not the best</p>


<h2>What is the future for open source?</h2>
<p> From its beginnings in the software community, open source now means different things to different people, depending on the experience and interactions they have had. From covering code ownership, licensing and development, it has become more important for technology projects. However, one thing it is not is a business model.

When companies open source their code, they still need to generate revenues to run successful businesses. However, they cannot charge royalties in the same way that other software companies might do. Instead, we see the rise of new business models accompanying this zero cost licensing, which allow generation of revenue alongside giving away code. For many years, this would rely on support and subscription models, but today this can include offering cloud services that make it easy to use the service.

However, what is to stop other companies doing exactly the same thing without contributing back to those projects? This can eat into the revenue opportunities that these companies have, as well as affecting the community around the project. Whilst the software itself may come without a direct cost to customers, maintaining the code and making it secure clearly has an ongoing cost for those involved. To date, this has been paid by the community of volunteers or businesses that have chosen to develop and maintain the code. However, with so much of our infrastructure and digital services today depending on those open source code projects, there is now a more compelling argument that Governments and public sector organisations now need to actively contribute to and support the open source model too.<p>
